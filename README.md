## What's this?

A prototype django application that allows to extract functions definitions from Extempore's source code, save it into a database and render it via a simple HTML interface. 

Demo: http://hacks.michelepasin.org/extempore/

> note: this app should be installed within a Django project (tested on django 1.3)
